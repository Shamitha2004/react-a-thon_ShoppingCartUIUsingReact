# Frontend Application for a Shopping Cart using React 
## Background: 
Online  shopping  has  become  an  integral  part  of  modern  retail,  providing  users  with 
the  convenience  of  browsing  and  purchasing  products  from  the  comfort  of  their 
homes.  An  efficient  and  user-friendly  frontend  for  an  online  shopping  cart  is  crucial 
for  delivering  a  seamless  shopping  experience.  React,  a  popular  JavaScript  library, 
can be employed to create an interactive and responsive interface. 
## Problem Statement: 
Your task is to create the frontend of a shopping cart application using React, a 
JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application should allow users to 
explore the available product details, view their details, and make purchases in an 
intuitive and user-friendly manner. 
### Requirements: 
1.  Product Catalogue:  Implement a catalogue of available products with 
images, names, prices, and other relevant details. 
2.  Search and Filter:  Provide a search functionality allowing users to search for 
products by name, category, or any other relevant criteria. 
3.  Product Details:  Implement a feature that displays  detailed information 
about each product when clicked, including specifications, customer reviews, 
and related items. 
4.  Shopping Cart:  Enable users to add products to a shopping  cart, view the 
cart contents, and proceed to checkout. Display the selected items with their 
quantities 
5.  Signup Form  (Optional)  : Develop a user registration form. Include fields for name, email, password, and confirm password. 
6.  Responsive Design (Optional) :Ensure that the website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices and screen sizes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
